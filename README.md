### Hi 👋 I'm Elaine Fan
I have a background as an occupational therapist and early childhood teacher.	
My programming journey began with self-directed learning through various online resources. These explorations made me realize I want to devote myself to this field wholeheartedly.
- 👯 I'm currently working on projects with wonderful people. 
- 🤔 I'm interested in expanding product features to enhance the user experience. An intuitive interface is what I value most.

### Tools I use 🔧
