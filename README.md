### Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Elaine Fan
I have a background as an occupational therapist and early childhood teacher.	
My programming journey began with self-directed learning through various online resources. These explorations made me realize I want to devote myself to this field wholeheartedly.
I'm currently working on projects with wonderful people. I'm interested in expanding product features to enhance the user experience. An intuitive interface is what I value most.

### Tools I use ðŸ”§
